===========

## Step 1

Create your resource files (.resx) as usual.

## Step 2

Tell us which resource files you want to use.

## Step 3

Just call extension method `.i18n()` on your strings or enum. Their content will be translated according to the resource files. See tests for examples on usage and strategy for failed lookups.
